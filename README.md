# The Archives

This React project is just all the resources I use for reference when playing Destiny 2 all under one place. I figured I might as well share this if anyone wants to see the source code or use it as well. Some of these resources I use are items such as encounter images, red border instructions for raids, etc.

I may update this project in the future when they add more dungeons or raids. For now, this project will include all raids and dungeons that are currently in the game as of March 2025.

Any resources I link will be given credit to the posters I acquired it from. If any of the given credit is incorrect, please feel free to contact me letting me know that way I can update it.

I'm sure there are other websites that are similar to this one that I am creating. However, I would like to get the practice in on creating a React project along with just being motivated to work on something.
